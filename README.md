Code to reproduce the work in the study "Robust Foreshock Rate Estimates in Southern California Considering Sensitivity to Mainshock Selection, Earthquake Catalog and Foreshock Definition".

1. Download this folder.  
2. Create a new python environment e.g. 'conda create -n foreshock_rate_estimates python=3.11'
3. Activate the environment: 'conda activate foreshock_rate_estimates'
4. Run: 'pip install statseis' (https://pypi.org/project/statseis/)
5. Open the ipynb files in VScode.
6. Choose 'foreshock_rate_estimates' as the kernel.
7. The notebook should run and reproduce all the work and figures from the study.
